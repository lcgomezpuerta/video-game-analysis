# Video Game Market Analysis (ICE Store) 🎮
Summary:

The goal of this project was to identify success patterns in the global video game market to optimize the 2017 marketing strategy for the "Ice" online store. I performed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical data dating back to 2016, where I cleaned missing values, handled "TBD" entries, and analyzed the lifecycle of various platforms. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), I visualized regional consumer profiles (NA, EU, JP) and conducted statistical hypothesis testing (T-tests) via Scipy to compare user ratings across platforms and genres. The analysis successfully pinpointed the most profitable gaming segments and platforms with growing market shares, providing a data-driven foundation for budget allocation and advertising campaigns.
